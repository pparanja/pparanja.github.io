        <p>Thank you for visiting my website. 

            I am interested in learning about computer science fundamentals and its application. 
            I have been in IT industry for about 7 years and learning something new each day. Currently, I work at 
            Microsoft on Windows Client side library to handle authentication/ authorization flows. Prior to this, 
            I worked at Cisco Systems primarily on a component called Endpoint Manager on Nexus-9K switch. This involved
            working on data plane forwarding for layer-2 and layer-3 endpoints.
            
            I enjoy reading about economics, geopolitics and I love theater!
