Hello!

Thank you for visiting my website. 

My name is Prathamesh. I am interested in learning about computer science fundamentals and its application. 
I have been in IT industry for about 7 years and learning something new each day. Currently, I work at 
Microsoft on Windows Client side library to handle authentication/ authorization flows. Prior to this, 
I worked at Cisco Systems primarily on a component called Endpoint Manager on Nexus-9K switch. This involved
working on data plane forwarding for layer-2 and layer-3 endpoints.

I enjoy reading about economics, geopolitics and I love theater!
